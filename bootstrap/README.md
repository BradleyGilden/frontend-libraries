* Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework developed by Twitter. It's a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools designed to help developers build responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications. Here are some key points about Bootstrap:

* Responsive Design: One of Bootstrap's main features is its grid system, which allows developers to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

* Pre-designed Components: Bootstrap comes with a variety of pre-designed UI components such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, carousels, modals, and more. These components can be easily customized and integrated into your project.

* CSS Framework: Bootstrap includes a powerful and flexible set of CSS classes that make styling and theming consistent across different elements. It also provides a default theme, but you can easily customize it to match your project's design.

* JavaScript Plugins: Bootstrap includes several JavaScript plugins, such as modal windows, tooltips, and carousels, which enhance the functionality and interactivity of your website without requiring you to write complex JavaScript code.

* Easy to Use: One of the main advantages of Bootstrap is its simplicity and ease of use. Even developers with basic HTML and CSS knowledge can quickly get started and create professional-looking websites.

* Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5: Bootstrap 4 was the previous major version, and Bootstrap 5 is the latest version, as of my last knowledge update in January 2022. Bootstrap 5 introduced some changes and improvements, including dropping jQuery as a dependency.
